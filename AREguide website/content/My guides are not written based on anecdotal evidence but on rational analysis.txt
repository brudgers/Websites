So far as I am aware, my guides are the only ones written by a person who has actually taken the computerized ARE (or who has actually analyzed thousands of practice vignettes or extensively written about the Exam.)  
</p>
<p>
Unlike other guides, I have explicitly stated my assumptions about the test structure.  You can read my <a href=" http://blog.arefaq.com/?p=36"> "Theory of the Architect Registration Exam"</a>  And of course there's much more about the ARE and NCARB at  <a href=http://blog.arefaq.com> my blog </a>.

<p>
My guides are based on rational analysis of the test, and you can experience the difference that makes for free with my analysis of the <a href=" http://www.areguide.com/SG%20General%20Test%20Directions.aspx
" >General Test Directions for the Graphic Vignettes</a>.
