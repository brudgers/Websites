A project I coded up and occasionaly link to during discussions on Hacker News. It calculates how much stock in a company is required at various exit points. The numbers returned are very crude.


####AREGuide Website####

Was built to sell study Guides for the Architect Registration Exam - business that was more trouble than it was worth - the price point was too low to create perceived value and too low to make processing sales worthwhile.

I can however recommend the Drumlin Reader as a cost effective tool for managing DRM, should DRM appear desirable.
